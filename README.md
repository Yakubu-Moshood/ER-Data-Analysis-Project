### **Analysis**
#### a. Trends in ER Patient Visits

#### I. What are patient visit peak times (days and hours)?

-![Trends (Hours and Days) Dashboard](https://github.com/Yakubu-Moshood/ER-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/4fe6de8dd23d39fdd3e25067a4ea8b8b61279e67/Time%20Trends%20Peak%20times%20(days%20and%20hours)%20for%20patient%20visits%20to%20the%20ER.png)

- Peak Times: Saturdays at 11:00 PM see the highest traffic, likely reflecting late-night emergencies.
- Observation: Such late-night peaks might reflect emergency incidents or delays in seeking medical care during earlier hours.

---

#### ii. Do patient visit patterns vary by gender, age, or race?

![Visit Pattern by Patient Demographics](https://github.com/Yakubu-Moshood/ER-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/4fe6de8dd23d39fdd3e25067a4ea8b8b61279e67/Patient%20visit%20patterns%20by%20race%2C%20age%20and%20gender.png)

- Patient Visit by Race
White patients (27.92%) form the largest group, followed by African Americans (21.16%), demonstrating inclusivity in patient care.
- Patients Visit by Gender
Male patients slightly outnumber females (4.7K vs. 4.5K), with the balanced gender distribution suggesting possible healthcare patterns worth investigating.
- Patients Visit by Age Group
Adults dominate ER visits with 5,000 visits, followed by seniors (2,200 visits) and children (2,000 visits), highlighting the need to prioritize resources for adults while tailoring care for seniors and children

---

#### iii Are there seasonal or monthly trends affecting ER visits?

![Seasonal/Monthly Trends](https://github.com/Yakubu-Moshood/ER-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/4fe6de8dd23d39fdd3e25067a4ea8b8b61279e67/Seasonal%20Visit%20Pattern.png)

- Peak Months
August (1,021 visits) and June (985 visits) are the busiest months. October (964 visits) and September (935 visits) also experience high volumes.
- Lowest Months
February (428 visits), December (487 visits), and November (464 visits) see the least activity.
- Summer months (June, July, and August) have significantly higher patient volumes, potentially linked to outdoor activities, injuries, or heat-related illnesses. Winter months (December and February) have the lowest visits, likely due to reduced activity levels and fewer external injuries.

### b. Wait Times and Satisfaction

![Wait Times and Satisfaction](https://github.com/Yakubu-Moshood/ER-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/4fe6de8dd23d39fdd3e25067a4ea8b8b61279e67/Average%20wait%20time%20and%20satisfaction.png)

#### i. How long do patients wait on average across all visits?

- Average Wait Time
Patients wait around 35 minutes on average across all visits.

#### ii. Which departments have the longest and shortest wait times?

- Longest Waits
Neurology and Physiotherapy report the highest wait times (37 minutes) while General Practice and Renal have the shortest wait times (35 minutes).

#### iii. Is there a relationship between wait times and satisfaction scores?

- Satisfaction Correlation
A negative relationship exists between wait times and satisfaction scores. This is evident from the trend line showing that as wait times increase, satisfaction scores tend to decrease. However, the variation is not extreme, suggesting other factors also contribute to satisfaction.

#### iv. Do wait times differ by patient demographics (e.g., gender, age, or race)?

- Male patients experience slightly longer wait times (35.40 minutes) compared to females (35.11 minutes), though the difference is minimal.
- Children face the highest average wait times at 35.45 minutes, with adults and seniors averaging 35.24 and 35.11 minutes, respectively.
- Among racial groups, Native American/Alaska Native patients have the longest wait times (35.69 minutes), while Pacific Islander patients experience the shortest (34.64 minutes).

### c. Department Referrals
![Department Referrals](https://github.com/Yakubu-Moshood/ER-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/4fe6de8dd23d39fdd3e25067a4ea8b8b61279e67/Department%20referral.png)

#### i. Which departments receive the highest number of referrals?

- Highest Referrals
General Practice (1,834) and Orthopaedics (992) handle the most referrals, which may strain resources.

- Are there any patterns or bottlenecks in specific departments causing delays?
Departments with high volumes may face delays, while those with moderate loads better balance service quality and efficiency as seen in the visuals above.

#### ii. Do satisfaction scores vary by department?

- Satisfaction Scores 
Gastroenterology (5.8) and Neurology (5.3) excel in satisfaction, while Renal (4.6) and Orthopaedics (4.9) show areas for improvement.
